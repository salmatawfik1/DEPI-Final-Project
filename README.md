My graduation project from Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), in which me and my teammates simulated a SOHO network infrastructure on packet tracer, configuring:
- VLANs, DHCP per VLAN, inter-VLAN routing. 
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic filtering.
- Router and switch security measures. 
- Performed extensive testing and troubleshooting to ensure network reliability and performance.
